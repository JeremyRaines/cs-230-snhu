Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

In an effort to reach more customers, social media company Chat Away wanted to develop a mobile platform version of their website. The app needed to be distributable in both Android and iPhone app stores. Budget and timeline were a high priority within the project.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I believe I did well in highlighting the relative strengths and weakness of potential solutions.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Some amount of discovery about a project is always helpful. That is, lay out the potential directions and then try to describe what each adds or subtracts from the project. I think the most difficult part was knowing when I had done enough.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I missed a few key ideas when evaluating the different platforms that were key to the success of the application, most namely security. Secure coding practices and other secuity ideas should always be of most importance and should have not been missed.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
